In the world of Utopia, there is an unseen force called mana that collects and flows in organic ways, purely of its own device. Though this is more concentrated and more residual in some places, the layer on Pia and Uto is always enough for a single caster to cast basic spells.

## Casting Rules

Any creature is capable of casting spells. The truth of a spell is that they pierce the Aether, a dimension with no mass or matter but infinite information. Every spell pierces with a certain calculation tied to it, pulling different effects from different places around the planar universe based on the formula tied in.

Different casters have different styles of casting; some sing a melody, some draw scriptures in the air. Each has their own style passed down to them or a way they taught themselves to remember these arcane codings.

### Casting Requirements

All spells require 3 turn actions to cast, as well as an amount of stamina predetermined by any given spell. The amount of stamina required to cast a spell, as well as any additional cost, should be detailed in each individual spell.

Every caster must observe a maximum called a Spellcap. Innately, your spellcap is equal to your Resolve score. This amount is the maximum amount of stamina you may spend on a single spell. For instance, without discounts, if you have a Resolve score of 7, you cannot cast a spell that costs 8 or more stamina.

If a spell has a discounted stamina cost, the discount is calculated before observing the spellcap. For instance, if a caster has a 2 stamina discount while having a Resolve score of 5, they can cast spells that naturally cost up to 7 stamina while only paying 5.

### Magical Mediums

Any spell can be cast through up to 1 meter of a solid medium. This means that the caster may force the spell's origin to travel up to 1 meter through the floor, through their weapon, through a wall, or a combination of all, before the spell activates. Without the Art of Array, this is the maximum range of a spell. The spell’s effects always spawn from where the spell’s origin ends up after casting.

## Standard and Custom Spells

There are a slew of spells that have been pre-built for any situation. These spells are simple, easy to grab when the time is right. Although, what they give in convenience, they take in efficiency.

For the more experienced, customized spells will be a much better match. Every custom spell will be tailored to the situation, specific to the caster's circumstantial needs. This can be done on the fly, and with any number of characteristics; changing the spell’s range, lifespan, effects, and a multitude of other things.

This chapter will detail a number of basic, pre-made spells. While learning how the system works, it’s recommended to start by modifying existing spells, then start from scratch when you feel inspired or can't find any basic spell that suit your needs.

### Combat Spells

The most primitive, but perhaps the most commonly used, combative magics. There's a lot of places in the world to pull destructive power, making demolition based spells the easiest to access for new casters. Controlling one's output is difficult, though, much like the venom of a dangerous animal in youth.

### Aid Spells

Deeper forms of healing are hard to come by, and magical healing never comes without a cost. Creatures cannot be healed by mana alone; rather spells are able to convert tangible materials into a healing effect, specifically when it comes to mortal wounds that may cost one their life. These effects are common amongst clerics and druids and take much practice to learn.

### Utility Spells

Magical spells come with a large plethora of capabilities, and utility magic attacks this need specifically. Often these spells will cover a huge amount of ground, spanning from disguises to summoning figures with specific shapes. Often, these are based on niche situations.

### Debilitation Spells

The various magics can be used in a multitude of situations, including and especially combat. However, veterans know that combat includes more than pure damage, birthing the need for debilitating spells. Simply, these spells don't harm the opponent as much as they simply hinder; either offering enough time to escape or enough pain to make it talk.

### Ascertainment Spells

One saying that many powerful diviners use is, "Mana has memory". This quote is not meant to be taken Literally, though some still often do. In reality, mana is an organic matter-energy enigma that takes on the characteristics of its surroundings, and the information it learns doing this can be accessed anywhere where the mana is still touching. Divination takes great advantage of this through ascertainment, the gathering of other wise-unreachable information.

### Animation Spells

Just because something isn’t built to be alive doesn’t mean it can’t be. Mana creates very powerful and versatile bonds, both mentally and physically, and may be used to bridge the gaps between non-living and somewhat-kinda-living. Often, this is used to reanimate dead bodies.
