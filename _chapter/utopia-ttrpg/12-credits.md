## Thank You

I want to thank anybody and everybody who support Utopia in its development, financial or otherwise.

This has been a project stuck in my head for nearly half a decade, and it's like nothing I can explain to see it on real paper with real bindings and real people playing it.

This experience is like nothing else I’ve ever felt, and I’m so appreciative of those who supported me every step of the way, pushing me to finally get it completed.

## Kickstarter Credits

In the finalized copy of Utopia, there will be a listed section in the credits for Kickstarter backers.

In some copies there will be two total lists, while in most copies there will be only. Certain backing rewards will grant a name in the published copy of Utopia TTRPG, whereas other options will only grant a name in the Kickstarter exclusive edition.
