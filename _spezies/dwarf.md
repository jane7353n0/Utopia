The most immutable of the beginning humanoids, dwarves became quickly capable of magic due to their natural resistance to mana. Beginning with the arcane arts, dwarves adapted habits of entire civilizations mastering one profession, becoming the most capable engines of that industry. Over centuries of work and determination, this flourished into a mental, physical, and social stubbornness that was unshakable. This unwavering force is so strong that, on the rare occasion that a group does adapt in new ways, a new biological subspecies may be formed, such as how the copper dwarves did.

Dwarves are mechanically simple to play but strong in specific fields of play, between item crafting and magic. They have stout stats, with their talent pool aiding predominately in defense. This pairs well with the offensive capability offered in their subspecies talent pools.

## Location

Dwarves riddle the populations of Uto and Pia, found in many different diverse regions. They are well-adapted to many environments and thrive as such, though many live more content lives isolated. Many societies have adapted to welcome dwarves, given they are natural-born laborers and specialized tradesmen.

## Lifespan and Genetics

Dwarves are highly resistant to medicine and drug, their genes resistant to mutation. Many dwarves share similar, common features such as dark hair and brown eyes, as their recessive genes are rare to come by and often smothered by those that are dominant. They live on average to the age of 200, though upwards of 300 years with proper medicine.

Prior to the colonization of Uto, dwarves began to split into two groups, now called the iron dwarves and copper dwarves. Involved with drastic conditions, the copper dwarfs’ common biology was altered enough for them to be deemed a separate subspecies. Iron dwarves and copper dwarves cannot produce offspring with one another.

## Background

Much like their genetic makeup, dwarves are extremely stubborn by nature. Many dive deep into the profession they find themselves in at youth and stay in that position until pardoned by death.

Dwarves share some ancestry with humans and more ancestry with elves. Though, after taking to the underground, their features, both physical and otherwise, changed drastically. The most ancient species of dwarves, crystal dwarves, were strong miners and exceptionally durable creatures. Although, as civilization began to sprout amongst Pia, crystal dwarves became hostile and cultish.

A firm pride that many dwarves hold is in their ancient generations constructing the foundations of spellcraft as it is used today. Even with eight total arcane arts used in the modern age, the primary four have not only stood the test of time but also served as a basis for more arcane arts to be constructed. Some dwarves hold this arcane nature deep in their blood, while others are just simply clever and bold with their magical signatures.

Even with pride in their ancestry, dwarves of differing subspecies clash socially. Their stubbornness and isolating tendencies can easily act as a catalyst for disagreement between the traditional souls and the innovative minds.

## Playing a Dwarf

Dwarves are ultimately a rather basic species for learning more advanced mechanics in Utopia. **Iron dwarves** have many talents that make them more powerful spellcasters, while **copper dwarves** offer more efficiency when it comes to craft.

All dwarves share a relatively defensive nature, leaning towards a tank style. A majority of dwarven talents help to build defense stats while they innately have a higher block rating than average.

Regardless of the playstyle, it’s important to take into account that dwarves often have a large stamina pool to take from. Iron dwarves can easily benefit from this due to spells requiring copious amounts of stamina, though copper dwarves need a bit of cunning to make good use of this. Most commonly, this resource is easiest abused with combat maneuvers, such as those found on the Warfare core talent tree.

Other synergistic talents depend on subspecies. Iron dwarves will find the **Magecraft core talent tree** nearly essential, given talents from this tree are required in order to cast spells. On the flip side, copper dwarves may find the most use from the **Innovation core talent tree**, allowing them not only to craft more powerful and valuable items, but also allowing them to use their naturally gifted mental traits and subtraits in place of (or in addition to) what would normally be used.
