Automaton is a blanket term, ranging from androids and robots to golems and homunculi. The use and creation of automatons exploded during the revela tions in both the arcane and the techno logical, though during separate instanc es. Even today, those that arenâ€™t sentient are often owned and built for the higher classes, serving as a luxury item. This is a point of contention in some places, as many automatons have become complex enough to be sentient, even when born into servitude.

Automatons are extremely unique in comparison to any other playable spe cies. Their inability to naturally regain stamina forces them to rely on items to expend energy. This is balanced by the fact that they do not need biological essentials, such as food or air.

## Location

Automatons are constructed and used as hired help all over the colonized universe. On some occasions, automa tons may be built with sentience simply for the sake of the creation of life.

## Livespan and Genetics

Automatons have varying lifespans, based on how they were constructed and what the purpose of their creator(s) were. More often than not, automatons do not age.

## Background

Automatons were first built by dwarves, specifically in the form of druidic golems. Since their initial creation, the use of golems spread throughout Pia for use as sentinels, tradesmen, and even companions.

Prior to and in the midst of the coloniza tion of Uto, golems within specific areas slowly transitioned towards androids. Similar in purpose, though with no arcane characteristics. Early android prototypes were primitive in comparison to common standards, but highly advanced for the time. Such inventions paved new grounds for modern robots.

On a modern scale, automatons roam freely in some cases, some capable of complex emotions and beliefs, going as far as being allowed citizenship in some societies including Uto. The android population on Uto battles the population of some other humanoids, as they are very common to be used for labor.
