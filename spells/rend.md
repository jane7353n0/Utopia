You slowly rip the soul of a creature from its body. It makes a Will contest against you and repeats the contest at the beginning of each turn for the spell's duration. Each time the creature fails, it's dealt Xd4 damage. Damage dealt this way cannot be blocked or dodged and is dealt directly to DHP, but cannot reduce the creature's DHP to less than 0. Upon succeeding, the spell ends.
