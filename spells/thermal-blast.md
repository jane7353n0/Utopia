Choose between Heat or Chill. You create a sphere of destructive power. Upon casting and at the beginning of each turn for the spell's duration, all targets are dealt Xd12 damage of the chosen type. Creatures may block or dodge damage dealt this way, and if the spell deals no damage in a turn, the spell ends.
