Spectral tendrils wrap themselves around a creature, bringing it to a near-halt. For the duration of the spell, its Land travel becomes 1 and both its Water and Air travel become 0. Upon casting and at the beginning of each turn for the spell's duration, it may make a Will test against you, ending the spell upon succeeding.
