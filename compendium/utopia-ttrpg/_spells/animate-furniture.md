Your fingertips brush against a piece of furniture and it springs into action. It comes to life, becoming a **DR 17 Animated Furniture**, reverting once the spell ends. It understands only you, and you may spend 1 turn action or 1 interrupt action to command it. You may recast the spell before it ends to continue control.
