An image leaps from your mind and presents itself as an illusionary object or image. It may be no larger than 1 meter in any dimension, but can be animated within its bounds in any way you choose, including changing it during the spell's duration. It is as realistic as you can imagine, though creatures that touch it will become immediately aware of its falsity. It dissipates once the spell ends.
