A creature spontaneously combusts with a phantasmal blue flame, feeling no pain whatsoever. Upon casting and at the beginning of each turn for the spell's duration, its dealt **4d4 Heat damage**. It may block or dodge the damage dealt this way, and if the spell deals no damage in a turn, the spell ends.
