You magically siphon some of the driving force of a creature, forcing its atrophy. For the duration of the spell, its Speed, Dexterity, Power, and Fortitude each decrease by 2, minimum of 0. Upon casting and at the beginning of each turn for the spell's duration, it may make a Will test against you, ending the spell upon succeeding.
