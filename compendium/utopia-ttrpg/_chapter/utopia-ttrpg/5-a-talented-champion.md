As you venture, you will amass experience and practice. Naturally, you may choose how your character adapts to the conditions using talents.

Talent trees, much like those of which your species has, are broken into branches and those are further broken into tiers.

Every species has a two-branch talent tree, each branch containing four tiers. Each subspecies has a single-branch tree with three tiers.

Beyond your species, there are five core trees that you can take talents from. These vary greatly in what they offer, and none of them have any requirements barring two: to have access to a talent, you must have each talent of the lower tier within that branch. For instance, in regards to the Warfare core tree, you cannot take the Recovery talent until you have already taken the Swift Strike talent followed by the Hasty Attacks talent.

## Core Talents

All players, and even some creatures, have access to the core talent trees. There are five total, each specializing in different facets of character development.

### Warefare

The Warfare core tree offers offensive talents, broken into three categories: ranged weapon attacks, ranged weapon attacks, and increasing attack speed. Generally, this tree is very stamina-intensive, so a large pool of Mind points or a high Endurance goes a long way.

### Tactics

The Tactics core tree is predominately defensive, offering talents that increase Block Rating and Dodge Rating, as well as talents that increase one's maneuverability in combat. This comes in the form of ignoring fall damage, using your weapon to aid in blocking, and gaining defensive buffs based on your armor.

### Innovation

The Innovation tree often works in line with crafting, though offers several benefits that aid both in crafting and in natural activity. The three branches are broken down into gaining the ability to craft higher rarity items, being able to craft more efficiently and effectively, and finding more uses for your intellectual subtraits and traits.

### Magecraft

The Magecraft tree is unique in design, as talents offering new arcane artistries are scattered throughout the tree, while the remainder aid in versatility when casting. Each artistry allows one to cast spells with new characteristics, whereas other talents may offer faster casting, the ability to cast on other creatures’ turns, or discounts to spells.

### Prowess

Finally, the Prowess tree is the smallest, most generic, and the most expensive for its value. As a trade to this, once one has gained every talent in a Prowess branch, they may start that branch from the beginning again.

## Specialist Talents

Beginning at a base level of 10 and followed by each 10 levels afterwards, your character is granted a specialist talent of your choice. These are cost-free talents that offer supplementary abilities. Often these are passive, but some active abilities exist.

Many talents, excluding some common variety, have special requirements you must meet in order to take them on. You must meet those requirements upon reaching a 10th level, otherwise that talent is deemed unavailable until the requirement is met. A prerequisite may be anything from a minimum subtrait score, acquiring a previous specialist talent, having a specific core talent, as well as others.

If you’re unsure of what specialist talent to take, consider checking the species specialist talents. Every species has one specialist talent specific to them; beyond that, there is a specialist talent centered around each subtrait, called Skill Specialist Talents. For instance, if your character is centered around Power, the Iron Gripped talent may be suitable. None of the Skill Specialist Talents have requirements and many will increase their respective subtrait score by 1.

The most powerful talents are called Ultimate Specialist Talents. These talents boast extreme capability, but also have the massive requirement of mastering an entire talent tree. Which talent tree needs to be mastered is specific to each Ultimate Specialist Talent.
