As an iron dwarf, the second oldest species of the dwarven race, your great ancestors were the founders of the fundamental Arcane Arts. Prior to their mastery, mana was used in some chaotic forms, though never to any level of control.

Ancient iron dwarves created the Art of Evocation, Array, Enchantment, and Wake. These arts carved a path for future spell casters, allowing new minds into the world of magecraft, thus changing ancient Pia for newer generations, for better or for worse.

Your ancient descendents spent most of their lives in extreme conditions, generally centered within mountains, active and otherwise, and deep caves. They adapted over centuries to poor air conditions, harsh climates, and the whims of nature of which they respected greatly. Now, these extreme climatesare rather comfortable to you. Nothing to be perturbed about.

Realy, your ancestors gave you a true gift: the ability to exist where nobody will bug you. You’ve been granted peace in a world covered in noisy, irritating, leggy creatures that keep trying to talk to you. They have no business being that talkative or that tall.

Magic is a fundamental part of life. It’s a part of your blood, your existence, it’s all built off of the arcane arts handed down to you. What cannot be solved with violence can be solved with magic, and obviously, most things can be resolved with violence.
