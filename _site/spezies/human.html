      <p>Humans are rare in comparison to most other humanoid species. With highly adaptable genes and easily mutated biology, theyâ€™ve become the butt-end of transmutational experiments and, in many historical cases, enslavement. Due to the mass hybridization, the number of pure humans have quickly dwindled. Now, they are held with high respect due to their scarcity and legacy.</p>

<p>Humans are very fluid and versatile, with no single strong characteristic. Low difficulty play including basic abilities and the ability to adapt from other species.</p>

<h2 id="location">Location</h2>

<p>Humans can be found all over the colonized universe, albeit on rare occasions. Their extreme adaptability, both physically and genetically, made them targets for early arcane experimentation and subjugation.</p>

<p>Due to the dark history of the human population, their numbers have dwindled greatly. Their sparsity amongst Uto and Pia, and their ability to procreate with several other humanoid species, has forced their numbers to flatline.</p>

<h2 id="lifespan-and-genetics">Lifespan and Genetics</h2>

<p>Humans have highly malleable genetics in comparison to any other sentient humanoid, making them optimal targets for testing. These creatures live up to 100 years naturally, though upwards of 250 years with proper medicine and healing.</p>

<h2 id="background">Background</h2>

<p>Humans were one of the first humanoid Pian species, walking chronologically with the elves and the dwarves.</p>

<p>Once primitive innovation initially sparked, humans became a common target for experimentation and oppression. Humans were often not highly capable in any specific area, making them easy targets to dominate.</p>

<p>In time, many humans built numbers and revolted their captors, allowing their freedom in hiding. After human independence became the standard in more Pian societies than otherwise, many human-pure communities were created, generally housing mostly refugees. Though, many of these societies were turned impure by lingering arcane effects such as lycanthropy.</p>

<p>Currently, most humans have been granted liberty, both due to higher complexity social advancements, as well as the creation of artificial humanoids aiding in servitude. Although, some primitive Piansocieties still enslave and farm humans.</p>
