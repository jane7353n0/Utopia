          <p>During your adventures, you’ll find plenty of knick-knacks and trinkets that make you substantially better at completing quests and ending lives. These items come in four distinct forms: weapons, armor, consumables, and artifacts.</p>

<p>Weapons naturally modify how many turn actions it’ll require for you to attack, as well as how much damage you deal for each attack. You can hold multiple weapons at once, though both will work at lower efficiency if you’re not trained properly.</p>

<p>Armor will take up one of four slots you have available: your head slot, your chest slot, your hands slot, or your feet slot. The most basic form of armor will either raise your defenses or offer you additional Block Rating or Dodge Rating. Though, some armor pieces have other specialized benefits.</p>

<p>Some pieces of armor have the Augmentable feature, meaning that you can make that piece of armor physically a part of you. You have one augmentable slot for each armor slot, meaning you have a head augment slot, a chest augment slot, a hands augment slot, and a feet augment slot. Augmenting is semi-permanent and may come with great consequence if one would like to change their mind.</p>

<p>For more information on how the slot system works, refer to Augmentation in the Armor and Equipment section of Playing the Game.</p>

<p>Consumables generally include potions, edible substances, salves, injections, and plenty of other things that only work a number of times before the item is destroyed or rendered useless.</p>

<p>Generally these come at lower costs due to their sparse use but also comprise one of the only forms of portable healing available.</p>

<p>Artifacts comprise just about every other item, including and not limited to back equipment, neck equipment, waist equipment, and rings. Some artifacts will take up one of those four slots, whereas others require a free hand to operate. These come with a plethora of unique features, including storing items, traversing terrain remotely, and offering passive buffs to the user.</p>

<h2 id="bulky-items-and-rarities">BULKY ITEMS AND RARITIES</h2>

<p>The number of slots that an item requires to hold is an important metric to consider. Even if you ignore carry capacity rules, consider that item rarities are based on how encumbering they are, and as such, some rules may need to be modified to reflect such a change.</p>

<p>For more information on how the slot system works, refer to Carry Capacity in the Travel section of Playing the Game.</p>

<h2 id="crafting-custom-items">CRAFTING CUSTOM ITEMS</h2>

<p>Sometimes, you’ll want to craft your own items to suit your needs, your style, and your vague moral gray areas. If you’re interested in designing your own weapons, armor, consumables, and artifacts, see more in the Advanced Rule’s Individual Artifice, where you’ll learn more about how to add specific characteristics to your items and where to find the components necessary to build them.</p>

<h2 id="components">COMPONENTS</h2>

<p>Components are the elements required to craft any item imaginable. They come in three general categories: material components, refinement components, and power components. Different varieties of items will require different amounts of each, whereas the rarity of an item will depict the exact rarity needed from components. Components may be crafted, harvested, or foraged and found naturally.</p>

<h2 id="foraging">FORAGING</h2>

<p>One of many ways an adventurer may stumble across new components to use in their travels is through foraging. This is the act of spending a long period of time searching for something specific. Such searches are thorough, generally spanning long periods of time and including searching above and beneath the surface when available.</p>

<p>Whenever a creature looks to forage for a component, they must make a test, generally an Awareness test, in a large foragable area. Foragable areas should be large and explorable and the exact amount of time a player is willing to spend foraging should be decided beforehand. The effects of the amount of time they spend will modify their roll.</p>

<h2 id="time-spent-foraging">TIME SPENT FORAGING</h2>

<p>A player may spend anywhere from 1 hour to 24 hours foraging for a single type of component. The more time spent, the more likely they are to find the component. In some cases, they may even find it faster than expected.</p>

<p>Below are the available amounts of time one may spend foraging, and how it affects the test made:
Time Spent1 hour4 hours8 hours12 hours18 hoursFORAGING RATINGS
Favor/Disfavor1 point of disfavorNo modifications1 point of favor2 points of favor3 points of favorEvery foragable component has aForaging Rating. When a player attempts to forage for a specific component, the GM will roll that component’s Foraging Rating (listed with each foragable component).</p>

<p>The foraging rating roll will dictate what roll the test, generally an Awareness test, will need to succeed in order to find the given resource. This means that even the rarest of materials may be found with great luck, though the rarer the material, the lower the chance of success.</p>

<p>Upon succeeding the test, the foraging player gains a random amount of the resource (possible amounts also listed with each foragable component). Upon failure, the full time is spent and no resource is found.</p>

<h2 id="exceptional-success-and-failure">EXCEPTIONAL SUCCESS AND FAILURE</h2>

<p>When a player makes a test against a foraging rating and succeeds the roll by double or more, the amount of time they spend searching for it will be reduced.</p>

<p>If the player’s test is over double what the foraging rating rolled, they find it in half the time. If the player’s test is over triple what the foraging rating rolled, they find it in a third of the time, so on.</p>

<p>In other cases, the component a player is trying to forage may be impossible to find, whether it be depleted or the player be searching in a barren biome. Regardless, the GM should take note of whether or not it is available beforehand.</p>

<p>This information may be disclosed to the player or kept from the player, predominantly based on how much information the character has and GM discretion. If a player attempts to forage for a component that is impossible to find in the given conditions, rolls always fail.</p>

<h2 id="material-components">MATERIAL COMPONENTS</h2>

<p>Material components are used to build the structural components of items. Often blades, plating, and framework are made from these. These are the most abundant form of components and the most common components used in crafting. Some items require only material components, though most if not all components require at least 1 material component.</p>

<p>The more powerful material components are, the more durable they are and the more powerful they are. A lot of the time, this also comes with heavier weights. Rarer material components are often required not only for sustaining constant use, but also to capacitate powerful inner-workings of complex items. Some items include powerful cores inside it that emit constant energy, and without a strong material to hold it, the item would destroy itself.</p>

<h2 id="crafting-material-components">CRAFTING MATERIAL COMPONENTS</h2>

<p>Material components can generally be crafted by combining lesser materials into a more powerful alloy or composite. As with all components, this excludes Crude Material Components.</p>

<p>When crafting a component, an Engineering test must be made. Upon failing, all components are destroyed. The following recipes may be used: ■ Extraordinary Material Component■ 2 Common Material Components■ TD 12 Engineering Test Rare Material Component■ 2 Extraordinary Material Components■ TD 18 Engineering TestLegendary Material Component■ 2 Rare Material Components■ TD 24 Engineering Test Mythical Material Component■ 2 Legendary Material Components■ TD 30 Engineering TestREFINEMENT COMPONENTS
Refinement components are small pieces that can make an item lighter, smaller, or even more efficient. This can be achieved through highly conductive materials, substances with strong arcane capacity, or even things as powerful as nanotechnology.</p>

<p>The most common forms of refinement components are precious metals and alchemical substrates. Precious metals allow devices to have a more refined electronic structure while more potent alchemical substances are able to capacitate more powerful runes.</p>

<h2 id="crafting-refinement">CRAFTING REFINEMENT</h2>

<h3 id="components-1">COMPONENTS</h3>

<p>Refinement components are created by engineering material components artificially. Rather than a metal or a substrait, these would become mechanisms in line with gear systems and nanotechnology, depending on the rarity.</p>

<p>When crafting a component, anEngineering test must be made. Upon failing, all components are destroyed. The following recipes may be used: • Extraordinary Refinement Component■ 1 Common Material Component■ 1 Extraordinary Material Component■ TD 14 Engineering TestRare Refinement Component■ 1 Extraordinary MaterialComponent■ 1 Rare Material Component■ TD 20 Engineering Test Legendary Refinement Component■ 1 Rare Material Component■ 1 Legendary Material Component■ TD 26 Engineering Test Mythical Refinement Component■ 1 Legendary Material Component■ 1 Mythical Material Component■ TD 32 Engineering TestPOWER COMPONENTS
Power components are the rarest form of component and are not seen in many items, especially those that are more common. Generaly, an item does not require one or more power components unless they hold a specific characteristic that requires such. Examples of characteristics that would require them include thermal attacks and sentience.</p>

<p>Power components produce or store usable energy, whether it be mechanicalor arcane in nature, to power their larger systems. Long ago, different types of cores and cells were designed specifically for this purpose, small devices that harness the output of different effects, such as chemical reactions and radiation.</p>

<h2 id="crafting-power-components">CRAFTING POWER COMPONENTS</h2>

<p>Power components are manufactured using a refinement component and a material component of the same rarity. This process will create a cel, something capable of storing and emitting energy as necessary. These range from things like coils to combustion chambers.</p>

<p>When crafting a component, anEngineering test must be made. Upon failing, all components are destroyed. The following recipes may be used: ■ Common Power Component■ 1 Common Material Component■ 1 Common Refinement Component■ TD 11 Engineering TestExtraordinary Power Component■ 1 Extraordinary MaterialComponent■ 1 Extraordinary RefinementComponent■ TD 17 Engineering Test Rare Power Component■ 1 Rare Material Component■ 1 Rare Refinement Component■ TD 23 Engineering Test Legendary Power Component■ 1 Legendary Material Component■ 1 Legendary RefinementComponent■ TD 29 Engineering Test Mythical Power Component■ 1 Mythical Material Component■ 1 Mythical Refinement Component■ TD 35 Engineering TestCREATURES
Throughout one’s travels, you’ll come across many different lifeforms. Some will be large, some will be small, several will try to kill you.</p>

<p>Creatures can be broken into 5 types: abominations, beasts, constructs, humanoids, and primordials. These types are further broken into classifications, with more than meaningful to list. Examples include goblinoids, arthropods, and the undead.</p>

<p>Each creature may use any Standard Action unless otherwise stated, and should have subtraits and traits similar to PCs. Each creature is controlled by the GM and its behaviors are dictated as such.</p>

<p>Unlike PCs, creatures may have a 0 as a subtrait score. This generally means that they are nearly incapable of making use of that given characteristic.</p>

<h2 id="difficulty-ratings">DIFFICULTY RATINGS</h2>

<p>Every creature has a Difficulty Rating (DR), which coincides with a player’s level. A DR 10 creature should be of similar capability to a level 10 character. This does not mean that a level 10 character will often survive the encounter.</p>

<p>A creature’s DR is grossly simplified, and doesn’t offer information on where a creature is strong or where a creature is weak. Circumstance weighs a lot in the fate of combat and survival, so GMs beware when producing combat situations. A level 10 character that can fly has a substantial chance of success against a level 100 terrestrial creature.</p>

<h2 id="drops-and-harvestables">DROPS AND HARVESTABLES</h2>

<p>Every creature grants an amount of XP based on its level of power. This may vary based on what items it’s holding. This XP should be granted if the players succeed in the encounter, and this does not always mean killing it. Persuasion and cunning may be the means to a successful encounter.</p>

<p>If a player enters an encounter without full success, such as killing a creature that they were meant to keep alive, they may be offered half XP. The same may be true if they stealth past the creature, kill the same type of creature a multitude of times, and in many other possible instances. If the encounter was entered with a party of players, the XP should be split evenly amongst them.</p>

<p>On top of XP, creatures have a number of items and harvestable parts they may offer upon incapacitation or death. Items are easy to obtain from dead creatures and slightly more difficult to obtain from living creatures, but harvestable components do require that the creature be dead or that the creature die in the process of harvesting.</p>

<p>Whenever an attempt is made to harvest from a creature, a test must be made based on the specific circumstance, listed on each creature’s stat block. For instance, if a player would like to harvest a creature’s bones, they must may have to make an Engineering test. If it succeeds the amount listed on the creature’s stat block, they are rewarded with more bones than they would have upon failure. This is generally due to either the components being rendered useless or destroyed completely.</p>
