      <h1>Creating a Character</h1>
      <p>Since your character will act as your avatar in the world of Utopia, you have full freedom to customize this character, from where its fundamental statistics are distributed, down to where they grew up and why they chose to embark on such a journey in the first place.</p>

<h2 id="species">SPECIES</h2>

<p>The first and most vital decision to make for your character is its species. There are seven core species to choose from: human, automaton, dwarf, cyborg, oxtus, elf, and cambion. More information can be found for each species in their respective chapters.</p>

<p>You’ll get strict bonuses, scale with different meters, and have access to different talents based on species. Each species is further specified into subspecies, further clarifying your character’s innate abilities and gifts as a creature.</p>

<p>If you’re having trouble deciding, you may want to find what type of character you want to play. If you’re looking to be a tank, you may find interest in solar elves. Whereas if you’re looking to play a tinkerer class, a copper dwarf would much better suit your needs. Check what type of role each species may play and see if it fits your style of play.</p>

<p>Once you’ve come to a decision, scribe the title of the chosen species and subspecies into the Species field, found in Boxl.</p>

<h2 id="setting-up-stats">SETTING UP STATS</h2>

<p>Next step, scribing in your static stats. First, write your Block Rating and Dodge Rating into Box 2. These can be found on your species page. Your character’s Block Rating, generally in the form of d4’s, is a metric of how well it can negate incoming damage that they’re aware of. Your character’s Dodge Rating, generally in the form of d12’s, is a metric of how well your character can avoid damage completely.</p>

<p>In Box 9, write in your Constitution, Endurance, and Effervescence based on your species.</p>

<p>Set your XP to 0 out of 1,000 in Box 5. Finally, set each of your defenses to 1 in Box 3. You will gain XP as you progress along your campaign. Once you’ve reached enough XP to level up, it will reset to 0 plus whatever XP carries over from leveling up. The amount of XP you need to level up is equal to 100 times the sum of your talent points and attributed points (overall level).</p>

<p>The dynamic stats will change over the course of character creation, but a base should be created for calculating. For now, set all of your subtraits, the smaller left-hand fields, in Box 8 to 1 each. Check the box next to each subtrait you are gifted in.</p>

<h2 id="talents">TALENTS</h2>

<p>Next part will be your choice. In Box 7, there are four fields: your spendable talent points at top, and 3 different attributed points; specifically, Body, Mind, and Soul points. You can spend Talent Points on talents, and you begin at level 10 with 10 Spendable Points. There are three types of trees you can spend these on: species talent trees, subspecies talent trees, and core talent trees. All talents cost a number of attributed points. When you obtain a talent, you convert your talent points to Body, Mind, and Soul points respective to the chosen talent’s cost.</p>

<p>Choose any number of talents you can afford, and write those talents down. Keep in mind, you don’t have to spend all your points. Rather, you may save up to 5 Spendable Points for talents in the future. Obtaining a talent may be done at instant speed with no cost of time, regardless of whether you’re in combat or enjoying downtime.</p>

<h2 id="specialist-talents">SPECIALIST TALENTS</h2>

<p>Every 10 levels, you’ll receive a specialist talent. Most specialist talents have prerequisites, anything from having specific talents, minimum score values, or even being a certain species.</p>

<p>To start off, being level 10, you’ll get your first initial specialist talent.</p>

<p>#- UPDATING STATS</p>

<p>Now that you have your attributed points in place, this will set the stage for your final character creation steps.</p>

<p>You’ll write in your Surface Health Points (SHP) in and Deep Health Points (DHP) in Box 4. The amount you have of each is based on your Body and Soul points respectively. The same is true for your stamina in Box 6, that of which is dependent on your Mind points.</p>

<p>Each of these stats are calculated as so: Maximum SHP is equal to [Body Score] * [Constitution] + [Level] ■ Maximum DHP is equal to [Soul Score] * [Effervescence] + [Level] Maximum stamina is equal to [Mind Score] * [Endurance] + [Level]
Over time, your maximum SHP, DHP, and stamina will increase as your Body, Mind, and Soul score increase. As well, you may increase your Constitution, Endurance, and Effervescence using the Prowess core talent tree. As these numbers change, your maximum stats will have to be recalculated.</p>

<p>Do note, the left-hand of each field is your current amount of a given total, which will change whenever you take damage or expend energy. The right-hand of each field is your maximum, which should only be modified when you obtain new talents.</p>

<p>Your surface health is a metric of external wounds. Maximum points means that you are unscathed, whereas having no points means you are heavily wounded. Your deep health measures internal and mortal wounds, such as broken appendages and system failure. Your character’s deep health is directly connected to their soul’s ability to continue piloting their body. When this drops to 0, their soul disconnects and their body dies.</p>

<p>Your stamina is the overall energy you may expend. Stamina is used not only for transit combat maneuvers such as sprinting, special attacks, and flying, but also for casting spells and committing daunting tasks.</p>

<p>When your character runs out of stamina, they will begin paying stamina costs with deep health.</p>

<p>Finally, you have a pool of 15 subtrait tallies you can spend on increasing your subtrait scores. The maximum of a given subtrait is based on the trait it’s a part of (with an exception that will be elaborated).</p>

<p>Strength and Agility based subtraits cannot be increased past your Body score, minimum of 1.</p>

<p>Intellect and Will based subtraits cannot be increased past your Mind score, minimum of 1.</p>

<p>Display and Charm based subtraits cannot be increased past your Soul score, minimum of 1.</p>

<p>The exception: the maximum for subtraits you are gifted in are doubled. For instance, if you have 4 Body points and you are gifted in Fortitude, you may have a maximum Fortitude of 8.</p>

<p>The exception: the maximum for subtraits you are gifted in are doubled. For instance, if you have 4 Body points and you are gifted in Fortitude, you may have a maximum Fortitude of 8.</p>

<h2 id="calculating-modifiers">CALCULATING MODIFIERS</h2>

<p>You’ll need to calculate your modifiers before you’re ready to begin adventuring. Each trait score is equal to the sum of its subtraits. For instance, if you have a Fortitude score of 3 and a Power scoreof 4, your Strength score is 7.</p>

<p>In the right-hand box of each subtrait, you will write a number equal to the respective subtrait minus 4. This number, called the subtrait’s modifier, can be negative or positive, and will actively affect rolls you make with the respective subtrait.</p>

<p>Another exception, subtraits you are gifted in cannot have a modifier less than +0.</p>

<p>Now, calculate modifiers similarly for your traits. The number will be written to the right of each trait.</p>

<h2 id="languages">LANGUAGES</h2>

<p>In the Languages text box, found in Box 13, make sure to write whatever languages your species knows innately. This will decide what creatures you can communicate with and which creatures will be across a language barrier.</p>

<h2 id="travel-speeds">TRAVEL SPEEDS</h2>

<p>The last thing you’ll need to do is update your character’s Travel speeds according to their subtraits in Box 10.</p>

<p>Your Land Travel is equal to your Speed score, plus any modifiers due to talents, items, or other effects (such as the Fast talent for Elves).</p>

<p>Your Water Travel is equal to half of your Speed score, rounded up, plus any modifiers due to talents, items, or other effects.</p>

<p>Your Air Travel will be 0 unless otherwise stated (only the Cambion species has an innate Air travel.)</p>
