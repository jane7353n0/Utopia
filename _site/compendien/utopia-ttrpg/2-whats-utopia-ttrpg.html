          <p>A tabletop roleplaying game (TTRPG) is a physical storytelling game played collaboratively between two or more players.</p>

<p>These stories may be woven in a physical setting or between virtual screens, but regardless, you will take one of two roles: the Game Master (GM) or a player.</p>

<h2 id="the-game-master">The Game Master</h2>

<p>The GM will take part in crafting the world around you, whether that be based on an original setting or an existing one, they will decide the outcome of every action.</p>

<p>As your adventure unfolds and the players carve new paths for themselves, the GM will produce new content for you to explore as you unravel it. Their story will be written for you to explore, and beneath every rock the players uncover will be something crafted by the GM.</p>

<p>It will also be the GM’s job to describe the world to you, the scenery, the detail, the interactions, the narrative as a whole. If you have a question about anything other than another player, the GM will have your answer.</p>

<h2 id="the-players">The Players</h2>

<p>A game may have as few as one player and as many as dozens of players, specifically depending on how big your table is and how much your GM is willing to put up with.</p>

<p>Each player will craft their own unique character that they will use as their avatar through the world of Utopia, and it will be your job as a player to decide that character’s actions, beliefs, behaviors, personality, and motivations. You will interact with this vast world through your character.</p>

<h2 id="pcs-and-npcs">PCs and NPCs</h2>

<p>You will come across many different characters in your travels, but any one of them will fit snugly into one of two categories: a Player Character (PC) or a Non-Player Character (NPC).</p>

<p>Simply, each player character is guided and controlled by a single player. All other characters (NPCs) are controlled and dictated by the GM. These may be characters as important as mentors, shopkeepers, or big-bad-evil-guys, or as small as the little bugs that crawled on your legs in that one nightmare you had last night.</p>

<h2 id="your-fate-and-the-dice">Your Fate and the Dice</h2>

<p>Whenever you have found yourself in a difficult situation, it’s more than likely that you will need a number of dice to decide your outcome. Most often, this will be in the form of a test, a roll made specifically based around a certain quality, such as your character’s Awareness or Dexterity. Tests are rolled with 3 six-sided dice, also known as 3d6.</p>

<h3 id="dice-nomenclature">Dice Nomenclature</h3>

<p>You will roll many different combinations of dice, of which there are seven main types: four-sided (d4), six-sided (d6), eight-sided (d8), ten-sided (dl0), percentile dice (also known as di0, but each numbers ends in 0, ranging from 00 to90), twelve-sided dice (d12), and twenty-sided dice (d20).</p>

<p>When you roll multiple dice, we will add the quantity directly before the dices’
type. For instance, 4 eight-sided dice will be represented as 4d8.</p>

<h2 id="who-are-you-game-master">Who are you, Game Master?</h2>

<p>As a Game Master (GM), you have a very unique role in this game: craft literally the entire world before the eyes of your players.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, it’s somewhat easier than it sounds.</p>

<h4 id="world-building">World Building</h4>

<p>While this may serve as the most fun and creative part, it will also be the most important aspect of your design.</p>

<p>Whether it be a part of your own custom setting or a setting you’ve grown up loving, it’s important that you have a consistent format to use. Ask yourself a couple of questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What is the geography and physical features of this world? How does a player get from one place to another?</li>
  <li>What are the important points of history that any generic civilian may know?</li>
  <li>How do different cultures interact with one-another?</li>
  <li>How do Utopia’s mechanics integrate with this world? How is magic flavored, how is crafting flavored?</li>
  <li>Does the setting provide agency for the players to explore?</li>
  <li>Can players shape or influence this world with their actions?</li>
</ul>

<p>It’s a tall task, but a rewarding one just as much. It’s important for you to have a baseline for how the world works in order to answer surprising questions about it in the future.</p>

<h4 id="scenario-design">Scenario Design</h4>

<p>There are a lot of ways for players to interact with the world, whether that be objects, dreams, creatures, characters, or something much larger than us. Although, you should have a vague narrative in mind for the players to follow.</p>

<p>Keep in mind how the interactions you bring to your players will guide them accordingly to their next objective, and how your players are capable of reacting. Note, your players can change the narrative, and it’s up to you whether to adapt or to bring your plot to them.</p>

<p>If the main plotline requires that the main antagonist (we’ll call them Evil Alex III) be detained at any cost, how will you drive your players towards this objective? Perhaps you set out a well-laid path, but your players decided to take a different route. You have a couple of choices: create a new antagonist, perhaps Evil Alex IV, or to have Evil Alex III block their new path (given, Alex is kind of clingy).</p>

<p>The world is yours (literally), but it’s important to keep the players interacting in an important way.</p>

<h4 id="non-player-characters">Non-Player Characters</h4>

<p>There are a lot of characters in any given world, and it’ll be your job to decide what they do and how they do each thing.</p>

<p>Not every character needs to have a heroic backstory or dead parents, though it may not be a bad idea to have some “modular pieces” on hand. For instance, you may have a hat full of names, a hat full of species, a hat full of personalities, and a hat full of backstories. When the time comes that you need to generate a character, you pull one piece of each hat, and now you have Tardvar the Great, a dwarven scout from the great mountains who ran from home!
Your NPCs will play a vital role in several facets of your play. The enemies are NPCs, the shopkeepers are NPCs, even the villains and mentors will be. How these characters interact with your players will be important for immersion and validity.</p>

<h4 id="rules-and-mechanics">Rules and Mechanics</h4>

<p>Utopia has plenty of rules and guides that you can reference back to, but the number of potential circumstances will always outweigh the number of pages in this book.</p>

<p>There will be many times where you will need to make a judgment call, where the rules will not give you an exact answer. Stay consistent.</p>

<p>It’s very easy to overpower your players, but it’s also easy to corner your players in such a way that they can’t reasonably escape. Consider your options, consider what makes sense, and craft yourself an “escape route” if you need one.</p>

<p>If you say no to a player being able to make a Stunt test to avoid some amount of fall damage, don’t let them do it again in the future. But do, perhaps, think of a way that they may survive a lethal fall otherwise.</p>

<h4 id="stories-and-narration">Stories and Narration</h4>

<p>The final shred of responsibility you have is simply execution.</p>

<p>Beyond just crafting this grand expanse, you must also convey it to the table. Describe the scenery, play the NPCs, attack as the monsters, give an unnecessary amount of exposition on Evil Alex Ill’s plans.</p>

<p>Some players opt for Roleplay (RP), where you physically embody each character, alter your voice according to their dialect, and reasonably act out the scenario. Others may choose they’d rather describe the scene, the occurrences, and the actions of each creature. The choice is up to you, but stay consistent, and stay immersive.</p>

<h2 id="who-are-you-player">Who are you, Player?</h2>

<p>The character you create will be your avatar in Utopia. This character will follow along the journey you take them, enacting your will down to what steps they take.</p>

<p>Throughout your adventuring career, you will gain new talents that allow you to acquire new capabilities and features. Over your time of playing, you will new abilities via talent trees that grant you access to new abilities that will make them unique in both style and practicality. These talents each take part and affect your character’s body, mind, and soul.</p>

<p>Your character will have multiple variables used to assess their overall capabilities. They will have trait scores, which express your character’s abilities to do certain tasks. These are further broken down into subtrait scores, which are more refined levels of capability.</p>

<p>Your character will also be one of the many, often humanoid, species that inhabit the world of Utopia. This selection will have the strongest impact on your character, and is difficult to change in the future once decided. Each species has several characteristics that will alter your play: the rate at which your pool of health and stamina scales, small talent trees specific to that species, and some trait and subtrait bonuses. Moreover, each species has a unique heritage that will affect their social status, influence their style of decision making, and produce unique interactions in the way of your campaign’s dedicated lore.</p>
