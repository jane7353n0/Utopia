      <h1>The World of Utopia</h1>
      <p>In the world of Utopia, you are native to one of two fractured worlds: Pia, the fantastical planet of the magic and mythical, or Uto, a moon colonized and innovated into a technological superpower.</p>

<p>Though they are independent of each other, they are not without peaceful communication. Many creatures travel between these bodies often, though the contrast in culture is stark.</p>

<h2 id="pia-and-uto">PIA AND UTO</h2>

<p>There are two planetary bodies that exist baked-in to the game’s setting. You may choose to keep this setting or replace it with one of your own.</p>

<p>Pia heavily resembles Earth, with similar land masses and ocean bodies. The big difference is the number of goblins and minotaurs.</p>

<p>This Earth-like body has a much larger population, but also a much sparser one. Territory lines are a bit foggier than usual and not all land is completely conquered. Each piece of land is broken into territories, and chunks of territories are further broken into cities, empires, or even small tribes.</p>

<p>Magic-users are common on Pia, as mana is much more rich there. Many mythical beasts such as hydras and griffons will be found on this body; it’s rich with flora and fauna, beautiful colors, and dangerous lore.</p>

<p>Uto, on the other hand, heavily resembles our moon, and was once barren as such. Approximately one century ago, Pians broke orbit and created a usable atmosphere to build infrastructure and civilization. This civilization is now known as the Utians.</p>

<p>This moon is densely populated and is now a whirring cityscape of innovation. Powerful technology, far surpassing what you have today; spanning from nanotechnology to kinetic force fields to holo light mobile devices to interplanetary travel.</p>

<p>Arcane arts are much more difficult on Uto due to a sparsity of mana; its lack of organic atmosphere, trees, flowers, and most life outside of humanoids makes it difficult for new life to flourish without an artificial touch.</p>
