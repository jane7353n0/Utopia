A vision comes to you, revealing some basic features of your future. You make a preminition roll of 3d6, saving it. The next time you would make a test within the spell's duration, you instead use the premonition roll, then roll a new premonition. If the test would have favor, duplicate the lowest die, and remove the highest die if it would have disfavor.
