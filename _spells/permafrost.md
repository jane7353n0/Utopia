A corrosive sheet of frost encases a creature, chilling its body and preventing it from moving. Upon casting and at the beginning of each turn for the spell's duration, it must make a Strength contest against your Will test, remaining Paralyzed until it succeeds. As well, it's dealt **4d4 Chill damage**. Creatures may block or dodge damage dealt this way, and if the spell deals no damage in a turn, the spell ends.
