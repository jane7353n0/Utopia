You send a magnetic grasp through your target, forcing everything around it to gravitate towards it with tremendous force. For the spell's duration, **all objects and creatures within 5 meters that weigh 200 kilograms or less are forcefull attracted to the target**. A creature may prevent this force on a specific entity with a successful TD 20 Strength test.
