A massive, indistinguishable illusion presents itself in front of you, design intricately through your mind. It may be no larger than 10 meters in any dimension, but can be animated within its bounds in any way you choose, including changing it during the spell's duration. It is as realistic as you can imagine, though creatures that touch it will become immediately aware of its falsity. It dissipates once the spell ends.
