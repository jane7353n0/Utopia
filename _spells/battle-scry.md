A fury runs through your aura, offering decisive battle stratagem to those around you. You choose one creature that the spell effects. For the duration of the spell, whenever you or another creature affected by the spell blocks or dodges an attack or spell from the chosen creature, its Block Rating and Dodge Rating is doubled for the rest of the action.
