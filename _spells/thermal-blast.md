Choose between **Heat or Chill**. You create a sphere of destructive power. Upon casting and at the beginning of each turn for the spell's duration, all targets are dealt **Xd12 damage of the chosen type**. Creatures may block or dodge damage dealt this way, and if the spell deals no damage in a turn, the spell ends.
