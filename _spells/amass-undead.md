Undeath fills the air around you, its tendrils drilling through the earth beneath your feet, attaching to each dead body it finds. Each body comes to life, becoming a **DR 13 Zombie**, each reverting once the spell ends. Each one understands only you, and you may spend 1 turn action or 1 interrupt action to command one or more of them. You may recast the spell before it ends to continue control, given each creature is within 10 meters of you.
