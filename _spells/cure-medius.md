You cast a healing light down, purifying one's wounds with great precision. Upon casting and at the beginning of each turn for the spell's duration, you must consume a Rare or rarer item or component. Upon doing so, the creature **regains Xd12 DHP**. This spell cannot force a creature to regain more than 100 DHP, and ends if you fail to consume an item or component.
