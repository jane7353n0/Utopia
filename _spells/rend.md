You slowly rip the soul of a creature from its body. It makes a Will contest against you and repeats the contest at the beginning of each turn for the spell's duration. Each time the creature fails, it's dealt **Xd4 damage**. Damage dealt this way cannot be blocked or dodged and is dealt **directly to DHP**, but cannot reduce the creature's DHP to less than 0. Upon succeeding, the spell ends.
