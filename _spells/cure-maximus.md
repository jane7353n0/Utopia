With ultimate force, you completely cleanse a creature of all undoing. Upon casting and at the beginning of each turn for the spell's duration, you must consume a Mythical or rarer item or component. Upon doing so, the creature **regains Xd12 DHP**. This spell ends if you fail to consume an item or component.
