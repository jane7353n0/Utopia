You burrow yourself into the mind of a creature, divulging its worst fear and looming it over their
shoulder, filling it with consistent dread. It makes a Will contest against you and repeats the contest at the beginning of each turn for the spell's duration. Each time the creature fails, it's dealt **2d6 Psyche damage** and feels as though it's being followed by its worst fear. Upon succeeding, the spell ends.
