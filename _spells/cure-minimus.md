You imbue a suffering creature with a surgical magic, clsoing their internal wounds. Upon casting and at the beginning of each turn for the spell's duration, you must consume a Common or rarer item or component. Upon doing so, the creature **regains Xd12 DHP**. This spell cannot force a creature to regain more than 25 DHP, and ends if you fail to consume an item or component.
