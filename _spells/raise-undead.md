Artificial life flows through your fingertips and into a deceased body. The body comes to life, becoming a **DR 13 Zombie**, reverting once the spell ends. It understands only you, and you may spend 1 turn action or 1 interrupt action to command it. You may recast the spell before it ends to continue control.
