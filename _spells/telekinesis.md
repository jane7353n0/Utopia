Your mind wraps its phantasmal hands around an object or creature, maneuvering it through force of will. Given it weighs no more than 100 kilograms, you move it anywhere within 10 meters of its starting location and may spend 1 turn action or 1 interrupt action to change its pathing during the spell's duration. Creatures with proper leverage may resist this effect by making a Strength contest against your Will test.
