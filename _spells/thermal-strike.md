Choose between **Heat or Chill**. You force thermal power unto your target. Upon casting and at the beginning of each turn for the spell's duration, it's dealt **Xd8 damage of the chosen type**. Creatures may block or dodge damage dealt this way, and if the spell deals no damage in a turn, the spell ends.
