You turn a small, inanimate object, such as a cup or a hammer, and breathe purpose into it. It comes to life, becoming a **DR 8 Animated Trinket**, reverting once the spell ends. It understands only you, and you may spend 1 turn action or 1 interrupt action to command it. You may recast the spell before it ends to continue control.
