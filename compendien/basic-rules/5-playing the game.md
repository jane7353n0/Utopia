In the world of Utopia, your character can do just about anything. Although, all creatures have limitations. Below arenot only the tools that all basic creatures have access to during gameplay, but also the trials and stipulations you must endure while adventuring, such as keeping your character fed, rested, and breathing.

It's a big world, and there’s a lot to take in. If the number of options is intimidating, imagine what your character would do, and see how that translates through this guide. How many turn actions would it take? What kind of resources would your character need to expend to complete this action in regards to your stats, such as stamina?

## LEVELING UP

When your character has gained enough experience to level up, there's a number of things that will change, and all for the better (probably).

## RESETTING YOUR XP

The amount of XP you need for each level should be 100 times your overall level. For instance, if you are level 20, you need 2,000 XP to get to level 21.

At level 10, once you’ve received 1,000 XP, your current XP will be set to 0, your level will increase by 1, and your needed XP will be set to 1,100. If you gained more XP than you needed to level, the remainder will carry over.

Your level can be tracked by adding your Spendable points, Body score, Mind score, and Soul score.

## INCREASING SUBTRAITS

When your character leVels up, you get achance to increase one of their subtraits, It may be any subtrait, though none of your character’s subtraits can go beyond its maximum:
Strength and Agility based subtraits cannot be increased past your Body score, minimum of 1.

Intellect and Will based subtraits cannot be increased past your Mind score, minimum of 1.

Display and Charm based subtraits cannot be increased past your Soul score, minimum of 1.

The exception: the maximum for subtraits you are gifted in are doubled. For instance, if you have 4 Body points and you are gifted in Fortitude, you may have a maximum Fortitude of 8.

## TRAIT AND SUBTRAIT USAGE

Each trait and subtrait corresponds to a potential test your character may make. Your circumstances change what test will be necessary.

Speed - Your Speed isn't just a direct correlation to how fast you can run in meters per second, but also how quickly you can gain momentum in a moment’s notice. This subtrait will affect how far you can move in a turn.

Dexterity - Your Dexterity includes how diligent your fine motor functions are, including sleight of hand, sneaking, and swiftness. This subtrait will affect how accurate you are with ranged weapons.

Power - Your Power resembles how much force you can put behind your swing or your leap. How much effort you can put into a swift motion.

Fortitude - Your Fortitude will constitute how much your body can handle, whether that be toxins, alcohol, or just simply a good beating.

Engineering - One’s Engineering is how well one may operate and manipulate a working system, including things such as technology or even the human body.

Memory - Your Memory score derives how well you can recall previously processed information. Not just ideas, but events in great detail.

Resolve - Your Resolve deduces how you react under pressure, a mental fortitude you hold. The more resolve you have, the more mental taxation you can withstand. This subtrait will affect the power of spells you can cast.

Awareness - Your level of Awareness shows how alert you are, how observant you are, and how prepared you are on a passive and active basis.

Portrayal - Your Portrayal helps you resemble something that you may not always be; this includes your ability to replicate social behavior, intimidate others, or simply lie.

Stunt - Your Stunt shows how well you can keep your balance understand your body in a three-dimensional space. The more stunt you have, the better you are at positioning yourself, regardless of your grounding.

Appeal - Simply, Appeal is how well you can communicate yourself to others in a beneficial manner. The more appealing you are, the better you are at interacting with others.

Language - Language is not only how well you speak, but rather how well you communicate with others. This skill includes how easy you can pick up new languages based on previous speech and writing patterns.

## GATHERING TALENTS

With each level, you gain a Spendable talent point. Talent points can be spent to gain talents, from either the core talent trees or from your specific species or subspecies tree. Remember, you don’t have to take any talents immediately. You may spend talent points on a talent at any moment, it doesn't even require actions. Although, once you’ve taken on a talent, the points you spend need to be reorganized into your Body, Mind, and Soul scores.

Once you’ve learned a talent, the maximum for some subtraits will be increased and your SHP, DHP, or stamina may be increased. Those stats must be calculated accordingly.

Each of these stats are calculated as so: ■ Maximum SHP is equal to [Body Score] * [Constitution] + [Level] Maximum DHP is equal to [Soul Score] \* [Effervescence] + [Level] Maximum stamina is equal to [Mind Score] \* [Endurance] + [Level]
Finally, if the level you’ve reached is a multiple of 10, you must choose a specialist talent. Many specialist talents have prerequisites, but as long as you meet the necessary requirements, youmay acquire it.

## TURN ACTIONS AND INTERRUPT ACTIONS

Turn acfjons ancj interrupt actions are temporal currency of Utopia. WhenyOU are facec| wjth a time-sensitivesituation, such as during combat, everything you do will require a number of turn actions or interrupt actions.

When time is of the essence, you will enter a turn-based encounter. On your turn, you are granted 6 turn actions to use, though you do not have to use all of them. When it’s not your turn, you are granted 2 interrupt actions. The number of interrupt actions you have available resets at the beginning of each other creature’s turn.

Each turn action and interrupt action represents 1 second of time, though actions may overlap and tangle with other actions. Each turn is approximately 6 seconds, 10 turns in a minute.

If you're in a time sensitive situation but not necessarily interacting with other creatures, it's possible that your turn actions will be independent of other creatures’. For instance, if your party is stuck in a room with only 1 minute of oxygen, your party may be granted 60 turn actions each to escape.

## INTERCHANGING ACTIONS

If you would like to take an action that requires turn actions when it’s not your turn or respond to something on your turn, you may exchange actions in the following way:
■ You may spend 2 interrupt actions as if they were 1 turn action.

■ You may spend 1 turn action as if it was 1 interrupt action.

## ROLLS AND TESTS

Any time a creature embarks on a task that requires some level of skill or has some level of difficulty, that creature will make a test.

Each test made is based on one of 6 traits or one of 12 subtraits. To make a test, such as a Power test, a player rolls 3d6 and adds their Power modifier to the roll. This roll’s outcome will determine how successful the player’s character is at doing the given task.

3D6
As a player, you will roll 3d6 many times during your adventures, this is a base-level set of dice. Unlike systems that use a d20 for a "test” or “check”, 3d6 reduces radicals. The chance of rolling a 10 with 3d6 is much higher than the chance of rolling a 17.

Keep in mind that the minimum roll for 3d6 is 3, and the maximum roll is 18, especially when considering test difficulty.

## TEST DIFFICULTY

For any given test, there should be a testdifficulty (TD).

The test difficulty is the minimum roll needed to succeed in doing the task.

For instance, if your character is attempting to dodge falling debris, they may make an Agility test. The GM will generate an appropriate TD, though often the players will not know what it is before rolling. In this example, it will be 10. If the character rolls a 10 or higher, they successfully avoid the debris.

## CONTESTING

Sometimes, you’ll be directly pitted against another opponent. In these cases, such as during an attempted grapple, you will contest another creature. This means that your test will be compared to another’s test, and the higher roll will win the contest.

## TIEBREAKERS

Any time a creature is rolling against another, whether that be durings tests, blocking, dodging, or other circumstances, there is a chance that both roll the same final number. In these cases:
If a PC is rolling against an NPC, the PC wins the tie.

• If either both creatures are PCs or both are NPCs and one creature is defending itself, the defending creature wins the tie.

• If the above is true and both or neither is defending, the creature with the better modifier wins the tie.

If the above is true and both have the same modifier, the creature of higher level or DR wins the tie.

■ If the above is true and both creatures have the same level or DR, oneis chosen at random.

## FAVOR AND DISFAVOR

If luck is on your side, or perhaps you are both blind and deaf, you may have some points of favor or disfavor on a roll. Any unruled circumstance that would push a roll slightly one way can cause a point of favor or disfavor, though exactly which events do are up to GM discretion.

For each point of favor you have on a roll, you roll an additional ld6. For each point of disfavor you have on a roll, you remove a d6. If you have enough disfavor to roll zero dice, the test is automatically failed.

## CRITICAL SUCCESSES AND FAILURES

On very rare occasions, a roll may be so successful (or so disastrous) that it has extreme outcomes. If three or more 6’s are rolled during a test, it is considered a critical success. Its roll’s overall value, before modifiers, is doubled. So if you roll 18 on a test using 3d6, treat it as if you rolled a 36. Critical successes are more likely withfavor and impossible with disfavor, due to the number of dice. If every die rolled during a test is a 1, it is considered a critical failure. The roll’s value becomes 0 and ignores modifiers. If you had a point of disfavor on a test and you rolled a 2, you would have rolled a critical failure. The outcome of critical successes and critical failures should have additional effects that aids or hinders the inten- tions respectively. The specifics of the outcome are up to GM discretion.

## STANDARD ACTIONS

Standard actions are actions that any creature is capable of, given it can foot the necessary costs. It’s important to be aware of your capabilities during tense moments such as combat.

## ATTACK

The Attack action allows a creature to make an attack against a creature or object. If not using a weapon, this requires 2 turn actions. Weaponless attacks naturally deal 1d8 Physical damage. Otherwise, the amount of turn actions necessary is depicted by the used weapon.

## MULTI-WEAPON ATTACKS

A creature may attack with any numberof weapons simultaneously, given it canuse all functionally this way. Whenmaking an attack this way, the number ofturn actions required is equal to the highest needed of the weapons. Rollsmade this way are reduced by half, rounded down. Modifiers, although, arestill calculated as normal when attacking this way.

## RANGED WEAPONS

Ranged weapons (weapons with 3 meters of range or more) should have two separate metrics: a close range and a far range (often detailed as close/farOr 30/60, for example). When you make an attack with a rangedweapon, you must make a Dexterity testagainst the number of meters away the target is. If it’s within the weapon’s closerange, you gain a point of favor, whereasyou gain a point of disfavor for targetswithin the weapon’s far range. Uponfailing the test, you miss the attack.

### AIM

The Aim action allows you to spend 1 turn action to increase your accuracy on a ranged attack. Whenever you take the Aim action, you gain 1 point of favor on your next ranged attack. If you take any actions after the Aim action but before making a ranged attack, you lose the effects of aiming.

### TRAVEL

The Travel action allows a creature to spend 1 turn action to move a number of meters equal to its travel distance.

There are 3 types of travel: Land travel, Water travel, and Air travel. These types of travel are detailed later in this chapter.

### STEALTH

If you would like to take an action while remaining inconspicuous, you must make a Dexterity test contested against each other present creatures’ Awareness score. The following conditions may affect this roll:
If any number of creatures were suspicious of your presence or have information on your potential location, you gain a point of disfavor. If you were already seen by creatures you’re attempting to remain inconspicuous from, they instead make an Awareness test against your Dexterity test. You gain a point of disfavor and each other creature gains a point of favor.

If you are entering an unsuspecting creature’s line of sight, you gain 2 points of disfavor.

For creatures that are gifted inAwareness, you must contest against double its Awareness score.

If the terrain or circumstance is distracting for potentially suspecting creatures, you gain a point of favor.

You may spend double the amount of time while attempting to remain inconspicuous to gain a point of favor on the test. This effect may be used up to twice per action.

## DEEP BREATH

The Deep Breath action allows a creature to spend 1 turn action to regain 1 stamina.

## LEAP

The Leap action allows a creature to spend 3 turn actions and 3 stamina to leap. The distance or height a creature can leap is equal to its Power score. If a creature used at least 2 meters of travel directly prior, its leap distance is equal to its Strength score instead.

## ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS

If a creature takes the Leap action in circumstances other than basic terrain under Pia’s gravity, the distance a creature may leap may change.

On Uto, the distance a creature can leap is multiplied by 6.

## BLOCK

If a creature is subject to damage from a source it is aware of, it may spend 1 turn action or 1 interrupt action to take the Block action. It rolls its Block Rating, reducing the damage dealt by the roll.

A creature cannot block or dodge a single source of damage more than once.

## DODGE

If a creature is subject to damage from a source it is aware of, it may spend 1 turn action or 1 interrupt action to take the Dodge action. It rolls its Dodge Rating. If the roll is equal to or higher than the damage that would be dealt after defenses, all damage is prevented.

A creature cannot block or dodge a single source of damage more than once.

## TAKE COVER

If a creature is subject to damage from a source they are aware of, it may spend 1 turn action or 1 interrupt action to take the Take Cover action, doubling its Block Rating and Dodge Rating for the rest of the turn.

In order for a creature to be able to take the Take Cover action, there must be an applicable obstacle against the source of damage.

## GRAPPLE

The Grapple action allows a creature to spend 3 turn actions and 2 stamina to attempt to restrain another adjacent creature that is the same size or smaller.

The targeted creature must make its choice of a Strength or Agility contest against the grappler’s Strength test. If the targeted creature fails, it becomes grappled.

Grappled creatures cannot take the Travel action. Whenever the grappler moves, the grappled creature moves similarly, though the grappler’s travel distances are halved, rounded up. When grappled, the Attack action requires twice the number of actions if it targets a creature other than the grappler.

A creature may spend 1 interrupt action or 2 turn actions as well as 2 stamina, up to once per turn, to attempt another contested Strength or Agility test against the grappler. If the grappler chooses to attempt the test, its stamina is reduced by 2.

## SCALE

The Scale action allows a creature to spend 3 turn actions and 4 stamina to attempt to climb onto another adjacent creature that is the same size or larger. The targeted creature must make a contest (Strength if it's equal size, Agility if it’s larger) against the scaling creature’s Agility test. If the targeted creature fails, the scaling creature successfully scales it.

When scaled, the Attack action requires twice the number of turn actions if it targets the creature scaling it. If the weight of the scaling creature surpasses its carry capacity, the creature becomes encumbered.

Whenever a scaled creature moves, the scaling creature moves similarly.

A creature may use 1 interrupt action or 2 turn actions, up to once per turn, to attempt another contested Strength or Agility test against the scaling creature. If the scaling creature chooses toattempt the test, its stamina is reducedHOLD ACTION
The Hold action allows a creature to conserve 2 turn actions for use of 1 interrupt action on a later turn. A creature holding an interrupt action may use it only once before it is expended.

Held actions are depleted if not used by the creature’s following turn.

## ASSIST

When another creature within applicable range takes an action, a creature may take the Assist action to aid. Outside of standard aid, the level of aid the action-taking creature receives and the number of interrupt actions required is up to GM discretion.

## STANDARD AIDS

A creature may spend an interrupt action to add 1d4 to a blocking creature’s Block Rating or 1 dl2 to a dodging creature’s Dodge Rating, any number of times per event. Creatures aided this way must be within 1 meter.

A creature may spend an interrupt action to aid a touching creature taking the Leap action, adding the aiding creature's Power score to the leaping creature’s leap distance. A creature may spend 2 interrupt actions to aid an adjacent grappling creature, adding its Strength test to the grappling creature's.

A creature may spend an interrupt action to aid another creature making a test. Some tests, such as Strength tests, may add the aiding creature’s roll to the aided creature’s. Otherwise, such as with Awareness tests, the aided creature is given a point of favor, as well as any points of favor or disfavor that the aiding creature would have received. Its roll is also increased by the aiding creature’s modifier, minimum of +1.

## ARMOR AND

## EQUIPMENT

There are eight total slots you can use to equip armor and items. This includes your chest, head, hands, feet, back, waist, neck, and ring slots. Unless otherwise stated, it takes 3 turn actions to don or doff a neck or ring item and 6 turn actions to don or doff any other type of armor.

Weapons can occupy one to two hands, exceptions left for customized items. A weapon may be sheathed or unsheathed with 1 turn action, though a creature may unsheathe a weapon without using turn actions if it's directly followed by an attack using the given weapon. Dropping a weapon does not require any turn actions.

## AUGMENTATION

On top of equipping, some items will have the Augmentable feature. This feature allows you to imbue that item into your body, relieving the slot it originally occupied. Only one item may be augmented per armor slot.

Both augmenting and de-augmenting an item each require 1 hour of time. De-augmenting, however, deals an amount of damage to the creature’s DHP equal to half of its maximum, rounded down.

## CONCENTRATION AND FOCUS

When it comes to tasks that require your direct attention, it may require you to focus or to concentrate.

## CONCENTRATION

Tasks that require concentration are tasks that require full, undivided attention. A creature can concentrate on only one thing at a time. If the concentrating creature takes any amount of damage from a source, it must make a Fortitude test against the amount of damage taken. Upon failing, it loses concentration.

Concentrating creatures cannot focus, cast spells, take the Attack action, the Block action, or the Dodge action.

## FOCUS

Tasks that require focus do not require utter fixation, but do require some level of consistent, extended attention. A creature can focus on a number of tasks equal to its Awareness score. When a focusing creature takes any amount of damage from a source, it must make a Fortitude test against the amount of damage taken. For each task it's focusing on beyond the first, it gets a point of disfavor. Upon failing the test, it loses focus on all tasks.

## RESTING

A creature may spend 6 hours resting, generally sleeping in this time. Sleeping is not required, although a lack of sleep will still cause points of Fatigue, regardless of rest.

After resting, a creature regains all missing SHP and stamina but does not regain any DHP this way.

## AILMENTS

When it comes to battle, there are a lot of ways to get hurt, and some pain lingers. Many of these ailments can be categorized and have specific effects.

## CONDITIONS

Conditions are specific, standard ailments. Each has its own debilitating effects that work against a creature.

## DEAFENED

A creature afflicted with Deafness has no audible sensation or stimulus.

It automatically fails tests that require hearing.

■ It gets a point of disfavor on Awareness tests.

## BLINDED

A creature afflicted with Blindness has no visual sensation or stimulus.

It automatically fails tests that require sight.

It gets 2 points of disfavor on Awareness tests.

■ Its Block Rating and Dodge Rating is halved, rounded down.

## UNCONSCIOUS

A creature afflicted with Unconsciousness may be treated as if it is sleeping, unable to use any senses.

■ It cannot take actions of any form.

It cannot concentrate or focus.

■ It fails all tests other than those made to end the effect.

## PARALYSIS

A creature that is Paralyzed has minimal control, if any control, over its motor functions.

It cannot take actions of any form.

It fails all tests using Strength or Agility traits or subtraits.

## DAZED

A creature afflicted with Daze is not able to take advantage of all of its turn assets.

It may only use half of its turn actions and half of its interrupt actions each turn, rounded down.

## ENVIRONMENTAL HARM

There are many ways to get hurt without being in combat, though some of those ways have special effects, more so than your standard bucket of “ouch”.

## CLIMATE

Not all climates are habitable, and even out of those that are, some may require special adaptations to survive.

If a creature is in temperatures below 0 degrees Celsius, it must make a Fortitude test every minute. It takes 1d4 Chill damage unless it succeeds X, where X is the number of degrees below 0 it is. The damage may increase per GM discretion.

If a creature is in temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius, it must make a Fortitude test every minute. It takes 1d4 Heat damage unless it succeeds X, where X is the number of degrees above 40 it is. The damage may increase per GM discretion.

## SUFFOCATION

A creature can go a number of turns equal to their Fortitude score without breathing before they begin to suffocate. For each turn they spend suffocating, it loses 1 stamina for each turn it has spent suffocating.

## STAMINA OVERPAY

If a creature would pay more stamina than it has available, two effects will trigger whatever stamina wasn’t able to be paid will be paid with DHP instead. As well, any creature with 0 stamina is rendered Unconscious. The creature will remain Unconscious until either its stamina is raised above 0 or it has completed a 6 hour rest. Creatures that rest this way only receive half of their maximum stamina and half of their maximum SHP, rounded down.

## KINETIC FORCE

When a creature abruptly begins or ends motion, such as hitting the ground after falling, it is dealt ld6 damage for every 10 meters per second it was traveling, rounded accordingly (10 meters per second is equal to 60 meters in a single turn). Damage dealt this way has no type and is dealt directly to DHP.

## LEVELS OF FATIGUE

With necessary body functions comes starvation and sleep deprivation, and with that comes Fatigue. If a creature becomes extremely exhausted or its necessities are neglected for long enough, Fatigue will begin to kick in.

These following actions will each cause a creature to gain a point of Fatigue. A point gained this way cannot be removed until the respective necessity is rectified. A single necessity going untended can stack for multiple points of Fatigue. Only 1 point can be removed every 24 hours if stacked this way.

Going 72 hours without eating.

Going 48 hours without sleeping. Going 24 hours without water.

Carrying more than your Carry Capacity (see Travel).

Each additional point of Fatigue has an effect:
■ 1 point - The creature cannot take the Deep Breath action.

■ 2 points - When the creature loses any amount of stamina, it loses double instead.

■ 3 points - The creature cannot regain stamina for any reason.

■ 4 points - The creature cannot cast spells. The Attack, Block, and Dodge action cost an amount of stamina equal to the number of points of Fatigue it has.

■ 5 points - The Travel action costs an amount of stamina equal to the number of points of Fatigue the creature has.

■ 6 points - The creature loses 1 point of stamina for each point of Fatigue it has every hour (not modified by other Fatigue multipliers).

## TRAVEL

There are three forms of travel a creature can use on any turn with no further assistance, given it has the ability to do so: Land travel, Water travel, and Air travel.

### LAND TRAVEL

The most common form of locomotion.

Land travel is the distance a creature can walk or run on flat, hard ground with a single Travel action.

A creature’s Land travel is equal to its Speed score unless otherwise modified.

### WATER TRAVEL

Water travel is the distance a creature can swim through a water-like liquid with a single Travel action.

A creature’s Water travel is equal to half its Speed score, rounded up, unless otherwise modified.

### AIR TRAVEL

Generally only available for creatures that can properly maneuver any direction in an open space, Air travel is the distance a creature can fly with a single Travel action.

A creature has an Air travel of 0 meters unless otherwise stated.

## CARRY CAPACITY

Every creature has a Carry Capacity based on its Strength score. The number of items, varying in size, that a creature can carry unburdened is based on the number of slots it has.

The number of slots a Medium creature has is equal to 5 times its Strength score. For Small creatures, it is 2 times, and for Large creatures it is 15 times (see Size Categories).

Currency and items that are augmented into a creature do not count against the number of slots it has available.

Every item and creature each require a number of available slots to possess, specific to the carriable entity. GM discretion may be required for items or creatures that do not have a listed number of slots.

## ENCUMBERMENT

Whenever a creature is holding or solely carrying more weight than its Carry Capacity, it becomes Encumbered.

Creatures gain a point of Fatigue when Encumbered, and this point is removed upon being relieved of additional weight. While Encumbered but not holding over double Carry Capacity, creatures may only properly use Land travel.

Creatures cannot physically carry more than double their Carry Capacity, and are in danger of being harmed when attempting to or being forced to do so. Essentially, a creature is being crushed rather than carrying anything at this point.

## SIZE CATEGORIES

All creatures and objects exist within a specific size category. These categories are used to substantiate how much other forces may affect it and how much it can modify itself.

The size of an object or creature is depicted while it’s in an idle or "resting" state.

## MINISCULE

Miniscule objects and creatures fit in a 5-centimeter cube while in a resting state. Examples range from diminutive insects to standard coins.

## TINY

Tiny objects and creatures do not fit in a 5-centimeter cube but do fit in a 40-cen- timeter cube. Examples include human footwear, gloves, and cutlery.

## SMALL

Small objects and creatures do not fit in a 40-centimeter cube but do fit in a 1-meter cube. Examples include standard shortswords used by humans or the average domesticated canine.

## MEDIUM

Medium objects and creatures do not fitjn a 1-meter cube but do fit in a 3-metercube. Examples include most humanoidsincluding humans, elves, and dwarves, LARGE
Large objects and creatures do not fit in a 3-meter cube but do fit in a 10-meter cube. Examples include vessels such as carts and canoes.

## HUGE

Huge objects and creatures do not fit in a 10-meter cube but do fit in a 40-meter cube. Examples include old trees and buildings of 5 to 6 stories.

## MASSIVE

Massive objects and creatures do not fit in a 40-meter cube but do fit in a 200-meter cube. Examples include standard skyscrapers and cargo ships.

## COLOSSAL

Colossal objects and creatures are too large to fit in a 200-meter cube while in a resting state. Examples range from intergalactic ships to living, breathing islands.

## LANGUAGE AND COMMUNICATION

There are two categories of languages that a creature can learn; simple languages and complex languages. Languages have three components: audible vocabulary, written vocabulary, or somatic components. Any given language may have all three or just a single one.

## SIMPLE LANGUAGES

A simple language has simple structure and can be learned by virtually any literate creature. There’s no special requirements to communicate with a simple language.

## UTOPIAN

Utopian is the most common language used in general. It's taught widely on both Uto and Pia, and serves as a common language between the two bodies. It has no special capabilities in showing emotion or complex thought, and is very simple in nature.

Spawning from Elvish, Utopian was created as a wide-spread form of communication. Thus, there is a somatic, verbal, and written form of Utopian.

A creature can learn Utopian with proper study material or tutelage by making a TD 10 Language test up to once each day after 3 hours of study. Upon succeeding 8 times, the creature successfully learns Utopian.

## ELVISH

Elvish is a rather ancient language that has been barely modified over centuries. It was first spoken, and currently is spoken, by elves and several other humanoid species. However, it also serves as a common second language on Pia.

Elvish is one of the first languages and is rather crude in comparison to newer ones. It comes only in verbal and writtenform.

A creature can learn Elvish with proper study material or tutelage by making TD 12 Language test up to once each day after 4 hours of study. Upon succeeding 10 times, the creature successfully learns Elvish.

## DWARVISH

The Dwarvish language is an evolved version of Elvish, first derived from ancient crystal dwarves. Its literary features were adapted for ease of learning spellcasting, making it slightly more complicated than Elvish while sacrificing some communication abilities.

Dwarvish is commonly used solely by dwarves, and even then is regularly treated as a second language. Although, some learning spellcasters may take the time to learn it for aid in their studies.

A creature can learn Dwarvish with proper study material or tutelage by making TD 11 Language test up to once each day after 4 hours of study. Upon succeeding 8 times, the creature successfully learns Dwarvish.

## APPARATUSCODE

Apparatus Code is a language used by much of technology, either on a simplistic level or in a very complicated manner. Beyond this intended use, it can be used to communicate ideas with very limited tools.

All of Apparatus Code is binary, meaning there’s only 2 characters that can be used called binits. This allows it to be communicated in multiple ways, including "0" or “1”, “red” or “blue", “left" or “right”, or any other recognizable pair. These binits can be used to create characters, and those characters to create words, and so on. Due to it only using 2 binits, it takes a long time to communicate a simple idea, but it can be done somatically, audibly, written, and sometimes even in more ways than that.

A creature can learn Apparatus Code with proper study or tutelage by making a TD 11 Memory test up to once each day after 4 hours of study. Upon succeeding5 times, the creature successfully learns Apparatus Code.

## COMPLEX LANGUAGES

Complex languages come with contingencies that are required to communicate with them. These contingencies may include a necessary body part in order to speak it or requiring echolocation receptors in order to understand it in full detail.

Even if a creature cannot fully use a complex language, it’s possible for it to somewhat comprehend it. Most often, this comes in the form of being able to understand it but not being able to speak it.

## OXTAN

The Oxtan language is one brought from an alien species called the oxtii, each one born naturally knowledgeable of the language, rather enigmatically.

Oxtii cannot speak, thus Oxtan has no verbal form. It is a sign language including a somatic form and written form. Given it’s built for oxtii communication, it’s more efficient to sign with two hands and three to five fingers, but still possible without.

However, the Oxtan language has special innate features when speaking telepathically. It is capable of communicating direct emotions to the recipient, such as excitement, anger, and hunger. A creature must be able to speak telepathically to use this feature.

A creature can learn Oxtan with proper study material or tutelage by making TD 15 Language test up to once each day after 5 hours of study. Upon succeeding 12 times, the creature successfully learns Oxtan.

## PRIMORDIAL

Primordial creatures are creatures of mana, intune with the ebb and flow of arcane energy by nature, not by practice. The language these creatures speak natively is barely a language, though its patterns are just strong enough to be studied.

The primordial language is spoken through mana and can express a huge plethora of ideas with few words. For this reason, it cannot be written and non-native speakers must be able to cast spells in order to communicate with it. Creatures unable to communicate with the Primordial language may perceive others speaking it as just humming or speaking in a light singing tone. A creature able to cast spells can learn Primordial with proper study material or tutelage by making a TD 18 Resolve test up to once each day after 6 hours of study. Upon succeeding 12 times, the creature successfully learns Primordial. 

## DYING (NOT RECOMMENDED)

There are two ways your character can die. The body can be killed outright, meaning that its body is not only dead, but it’s completely incapable ofsustaining life, preventing resuscitation. If your character dies without such annihilation, the body enters stasis.

While surface health is a creature’sbodily wounds, the true meaning behindtheir deep health is how well the body isattached to its soul. As a creature losesDHP, the body becomes less and lesscapable of holding onto its essence. This can easily be achieved by pure harm via destroying a creature’s body, Although, some effects such asnecromancy purely sever the connection, In these cases the body remains capable but the soul is forcefully shunted out.

More effervescent creatures are more resistant to severing effects and have a stronger attachment to their soul, allowing them to not only stay alive longer but stay attached while sustaining more intense injury.

## ENTERING STASIS

When a creature’s DHP is reduced to further damage will force its currentDHP into the negatives.

If a creature's DHP is reduced to an amount equal to 0 minus the creature's maximum DHP, its body becomes unusable. Until this point, the creature is but its body is in stasis.

< body in stasis is just capable enough to retain a creature’s soul once repaired back to its original function, though a body in stasis, by definition, has no soul attached to it.

A body in stasis loses 1 DHP every minute. Bodies in stasis may have its DHP healed, though its DHP cannot go above 0 until it is reconnected to a soul using an effect such as the Art of Necromancy.
